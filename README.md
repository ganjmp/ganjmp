Tea is essentially boiled herbs. So why is it considered a drink and not soup? 🤔

These are the things that run through my mind on a minute-by-minute basis. I think it's time for me to start meditation. I heard it's good for sharpening attention, and right now, mine is a dull butter knife.

I'm currently learning coding through school and some random side projects. Coding is cool because I see it like being a wizard 🧙‍♂️. You cast some spells with the right syntax and some magic happens. You could say my ultimate goal is to be a Gandalf some sort. It would be nice to cast a spell that folds my laundry for me. Or does AI do that already? I can't keep track. Maybe I can write code that folds virtual laundry?

And there you have it folks. That's a quick snippet on what a conversation with me would be like. Please feel free to reach out. 👌
